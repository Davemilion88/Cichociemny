This repository contains a simple HTML page (`index.html`) that sends your questions to a backend service. You can run it locally by opening the file in any web browser.

To pass your name and relationship to the page, append them as query parameters to the URL:

```
file:///path/to/index.html?name=YourName&relationship=YourRelation
```

Once the page loads, enter your question in the form and it will be sent along with the provided parameters.
